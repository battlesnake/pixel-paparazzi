Pixel Paparazzi / Notw ("News of the World")

NOTE/KNOWN BUGS: Probably doesn't play well on multi-monitor setups.

Takes pictures of things that it perhaps shouldn't.

Key shortcut       Tray-menu shortcut      Action
PRINTSCREEN        Left-click              Take snapshot, save to .\SG_<number>.bmp
ALT+SCROLLLOCK     (none)                  Subwindow (see below)
CTRL+C             Right-click             Close

Subwindow:
  By default, Notw takes screenshots of the entire desktop.  Put the cursor over a
  window of interest and use subwindow to set that window as the target, so that
  only that window is saved when screenshots are taken.  The target window will be
  flashed briefly to show that it is selected.  To subwindow a child window, simply
  keep using the subwindow shortcut until only the window of interest flashes.
